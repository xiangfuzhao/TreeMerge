Step 1. Run 0_MHS_TreeMerge.exe;

Step 2. Click "Browse(MCS).." to select an MCS family: choose an MCS file like "MCS_2_*.txt" if you test algorithms BAMHS, BHS-Tree, and DirectMerge algorithm; otherwise, choose an MCS file like "MCS_CBiTree_2_*.txt" to test TreeMerge and BasicTreeMerge.

Step 3. Download MHS2 algorithm in the website https://github.com/npcardoso/MHS2. Tansform an MCS file like "MCS_2_*.txt" into the 0-1 Matrix format file, and run MHS2 to get the result. You can also find the transformed Matrix files in the directory /RunMHS2/MCS_Matrix/.
